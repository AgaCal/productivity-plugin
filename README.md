# Productivity Plugin
## Manually Installing the Plugin
Copy over main.js, styles.css, manifest.json to your vault VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/productivity-plugin/.

## Using Reminders
Productivity reminders are notices that pop up periodically, sourcing images from your vault. 

If you want judgemental cats (or any other pictures), make a folder called 'assets' directly in your vault's directory, and put in any images you want displayed.
